= Deploying, Calling and Invoking Contracts

In this chapter, we'll explore how to interact with deployed Starknet contracts using _calling_ and _invoking_. We'll use the voting contract as an example.

* Calling contracts: Interacting with contract functions marked with the `#[view]` entry point. These functions do not alter the state of the network, so they don't require fees or signing. This is similar to a `call` in the Ethereum API.
* Invoking contracts: Interacting with contract functions marked with the `#[external]` entry point. These functions do alter the state of the network and require fees and signing. This is similar to a `deploy` in the Ethereum API.

== Deploying Account Contracts for Voters

Before interacting with the voting contract, we need to ensure that voter accounts are deployed as account contracts on Starknet. Each voter account must be registered and funded to participate in the voting process. This process is required since we are using Account Abstraction (more in this later in the book).

To deploy an account contract for a voter, follow these steps:

1) Create a new account with a name, for example, "voter_1":
[source,bash]
----
starknet new_account --account voter_1
----

2) Fund the newly created account (this can be done using a https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/[faucet] or transferring funds from another account). Wait for the transaction to be confirmed in L2. You can check the status of the transaction by copying the transaction hash into a block explorer such as https://testnet.starkscan.co/[Starkscan] or https://goerli.voyager.online/[Voyager]; the transaction should be confirmed in a few minutes.

3) Deploy the account contract:
[source,bash]
----
starknet deploy_account --account voter_1
----

Repeat these steps for each voter account you want to register in the voting contract.

Once we have deployed account contracts for all the voters, we can proceed with deploying and interacting with the voting contract.


== Deploying the Voting Contract

Before deploying you need to declare the contract. However, note that the contract has already been declared (Class Hash: 0x748762322d0ee8ee30e924ba68b0633ea704fa419e86a51bc1d75be4a115ca5) so you can skip this step. If you try to declare a contract that has been declared before you will receive an error, however, here is how you declare it:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ starknet declare --contract target/dev/scarb_project_Vote.sierra.json --account <deployer-account>
----

Wait for the transaction to be confirmed in L2. You can check the status of the transaction by copying the transaction hash into a block explorer such as https://testnet.starkscan.co/[Starkscan] or https://goerli.voyager.online/[Voyager]; the transaction should be confirmed in a few minutes at most.

Here's the command to deploy the voting contract, which will register voter_1, voter_2, and voter_3 as eligible voters. Note these are arguments that the constructor takes. Add as a voter an account that you have access to so you can vote with it later.

[source,bash]
----
starknet deploy --class_hash 0x748762322d0ee8ee30e924ba68b0633ea704fa419e86a51bc1d75be4a115ca5 --inputs <voter_1_address> <voter_2_address> <voter_3_address> --account <deployer-account> --max_fee 100000000000000000
----

The contract that we would be interacting has been deployed at address: *0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9*. You can find it https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9[here] on Starkscan.


== Verifying Voter Eligibility

Let's confirm that the registered voters are eligible to vote. We can use the `voter_can_vote` and `is_voter_registered` functions to do this. Since both functions are view functions, we can utilize the `starknet call` syntax to interact with them.

To check if a registered voter can vote, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
starknet call --function voter_can_vote --inputs <voter_1_address> --address 0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9 --account <deployer-account> 
----

Since we provided a registered voter address as an input, the result is 1 (boolean true), indicating the voter is eligible to vote.

Next, let's call the `is_voter_registered` function using an unregistered account address to observe the output:

[source, bash]
----
starknet call --function is_voter_registered --inputs <not_registered_address> --address 0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9 --account <deployer-account> 
----

With an unregistered account address, the terminal output is 0 (i.e., false), confirming that the account is not eligible to vote.

====
FUN ASSIGNMENT: Before proceeding to vote, ensure that all three voter accounts are registered and eligible to vote!

== Voting

With voter eligibility confirmed, we can now proceed to cast votes using the `vote` function. This function is marked as external, so we'll use the `starknet invoke` command to interact with it. This process is comparable to using `send` in the Ethereum API when interacting with a contract function that modifies the contract state.

The syntax for `invoke` is similar to `call`, but in this case, we'll provide the input as either 1 (Yes) or 0 (No) to represent our vote.

[source,bash]
----
//Voting Yes
starknet invoke --function vote --address 0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9 --inputs 1 --account voter_2

//Voting No
starknet invoke --function vote --address 0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9 --inputs 0 --account voter_3
----

Don't forget to cast a vote with the voter_1 account before moving on to the next step. 

== Viewing Vote Results

To view the results, we can call the `get_vote_results` function, which is a view function. We'll use the `starknet call` command.

[source,bash]
----
starknet call --function get_vote_status --address 0x027f4989d3cbf1654bc95f3e0083bb4542634c7cc8c7c406f17a4335fa5860a9 --account <deployer-account> 

//Example output if one voted Yes
1 0 100 0

//Example output if 2 votes Yes and 1 voted No
2 1 66 33
----

The output will display the number of "Yes" votes, the number of "No" votes, and their respective percentages.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and interacted with a voting smart contract on Starknet!
